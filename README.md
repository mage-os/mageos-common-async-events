# Mage-OS Common Asynchronous Events

Send REST requests to external endpoints asynchronously. This module implements the most common events like order creation and customer change.

This module uses the [Mage-OS Asynchronous Events](https://github.com/mage-os/mageos-async-events/) module as a basis.

## Installation

```
composer require mage-os/mageos-common-async-events
```

If you run into an error like "Could not find a version of package mage-os/mageos-common-async-events matching your minimum-stability (stable).", run this command instead:
```
composer require mage-os/mageos-common-async-events @dev
```

Enable and install the module:
```
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

## Usage

You can now use the following events without having to implement them yourself.
